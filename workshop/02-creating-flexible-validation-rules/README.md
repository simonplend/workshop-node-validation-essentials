# Part 2 ‚Äî Creating flexible validation rules with JSON Schema and Ajv

## üß† Learning objectives

- The benefits of defining validation rules with JSON Schema.
- Validating our data against a JSON schema with Ajv.
- How schema builders can help us build our JSON schemas faster.
- Adding custom validation logic with Ajv keywords.

- [ ] We're going to be using JSON Schema and Ajv in the context of an API
      built with Node.js, but it can be used anywhere: client side JavaScript,
      a command line tool etc.
