# Part 2 â€” Creating flexible validation rules with JSON Schema and Ajv

...

<!--

Outline:

- The benefits of defining validation rules with JSON Schema
- Validating our data against a JSON schema with Ajv
- Exercise 2.1
- How schema builders can help us build our JSON schemas faster
- Adding custom validation logic with Ajv keywords
- Exercise 2.2

TODO:

- [ ] Pull in content from article 'Get started with validation in Node.js'
- [ ] We're going to be using JSON Schema and Ajv in the context of an API
      built with Node.js, but it can be used anywhere: client side JavaScript,
      a command line tool etc.
