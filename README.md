you can run this command in your terminal:

```sh
node --version
```

## Setup before the workshop

<!-- > If you want to commit and push your work to your own repository on GitHub,
> you will need to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
> this repository, then clone your fork rather than this repository directly. -->

To prepare for the workshop, run these commands in your terminal:

```sh
# Clone the repository with git.
git clone https://github.com/simonplend/workshop-node-validation-essentials.git

cd workshop-node-validation-essentials

# Install all the dependencies in this project.
npm install
```

<!--
Once the dependencies have been installed, run this command to verify that
everything has been correctly installed:

```sh
TODO
```
-->

## Just before the workshop begins

Please open:

- This project in your code editor.
- A terminal window for running commands.

In your terminal, `cd` into the `workshop` directory in this project.

You're now ready for the workshop! ðŸ™Œ
